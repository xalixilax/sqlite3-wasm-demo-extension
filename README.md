# sqlite3-wasm-demo-extension

This repository takes the sample code from https://github.com/tomayac/sqlite3-wasm-demo/tree/main/public and converts it to run in an MV3 Chrome extension using React and Vite.

## Building

This project is written in TypeScript with React and uses Vite for building:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Build the extension:
   ```bash
   pnpm run build
   ```

This will compile the TypeScript source files from `src/` and bundle them with Vite into the `dist/` directory.

## Development

To run the development server with hot module reloading:
```bash
pnpm run dev
```

## Running

To run this extension:
* Load it as an unpacked extension into Chrome, pointing to the `dist/` directory.
* Click the extension's icon to open the extension in a new tab.

## Project Structure

- `src/` - TypeScript source files
  - `App.tsx` - Main React component
  - `main.tsx` - React entry point
  - `worker.ts` - SQLite Web Worker
  - `background.ts` - Chrome extension background service worker
- `public/` - Static assets (copied to dist during build)
  - `jswasm/` - SQLite WASM files
  - `manifest.json` - Chrome extension manifest
